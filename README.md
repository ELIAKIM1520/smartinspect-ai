üîç What It Does
SmartInspect.AI is a web-based tool that automatically analyzes inspection photos and videos from industrial or construction sites and generates compliance reports based on safety standards (e.g., OSHA, ISO). It detects whether workers are wearing helmets, safety vests, and other PPE, and flags hazardous conditions like unprotected edges, exposed wiring, or blocked exits.

üß† Hugging Face Tasks Used:
Object Detection (for identifying helmets, vests, tools, etc.)

Image Classification (to classify scenes as compliant/non-compliant)

Visual Question Answering (users can ask questions like "Are all workers wearing helmets?")

Text-to-Text Generation (for generating safety compliance reports)

Optional: Zero-Shot Object Detection (for generalizing to new gear or equipment)
üéØ Real-World Problem It Solves
Construction and industrial safety audits are manual, error-prone, and time-consuming.

Companies face fines and injuries due to overlooked safety violations.

This tool automates the first layer of compliance review, reducing costs and improving safety.
